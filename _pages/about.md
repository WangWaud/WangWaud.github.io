### **Major Achievements**  

Dr. Wang's research group focuses on plant disease control, particularly the interaction mechanisms among rice, symbiotic bacteria, and pathogens, as well as innovative applications. He has led 17 research projects funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (including the Excellent Young Scientists Fund, Regional Key Projects, General Projects, and Youth Projects), the National Key R&D Program (including projects, sub-projects, and topics), the Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation (Major and Youth Projects), and the Hangzhou Municipal Natural Science Foundation (Key Projects). His research has elucidated the molecular mechanisms by which symbiotic bacteria regulate rice disease resistance, established a platform for mining and precise engineering of rice symbiotic bacterial resources, and developed biological control technologies based on rice symbiotic bacteria, which have been successfully applied in practice. These contributions have laid a solid foundation for overcoming bottlenecks in plant disease biocontrol through effective utilization of symbiotic bacterial resources.  

His research has resulted in seven authorized national invention patents and the publication of 84 papers in leading international journals, including *Nature Microbiology* (2024, 2023), *Nature Plants* (2024, 2021), and *Nature Food* (2022). Among these, seven papers were selected as cover articles, five were designated as ESI Highly Cited Papers, one ranked among the top 0.1% of globally hot papers, and one received the highest-star recommendation from F1000. His work has been positively highlighted and reviewed in journals such as *Nature*, *Science*, *Nature Reviews Microbiology*, *Nature Plants*, and *PNAS*.  

Dr. Wang has received numerous accolades, including the Young Scientist Award from the Chinese Society of Agronomy, the Outstanding Young and Middle-Aged Scientist Award in Pesticide Science, the First Prize of the Zhejiang Provincial Agricultural Harvest Award (Second Place), the 2019–2023 Zhejiang Provincial Advanced Individual Award for Plant Protection Technology Promotion, the Zhejiang University Top Ten Academic Achievements for Young Scholars, and the Elsevier China Gold Open Access High Download Paper Scholar Award.
